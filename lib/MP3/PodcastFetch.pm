MP3::PodcastFetch -- Fetch and manage a podcast subscription

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use MP3::PodcastFetch;
 my $feed  = MP3::PodcastFetch->new(-base => '/tmp/podcasts',
                                    -rss  => 'http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=500001'
                                    -rewrite_filename => 1,
                                    -upgrade_tag => 'auto');

    print $file,"\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a convenient and simple way of mirroring the
podcasts described by an RSS feed into a local directory. It was
written as the backend for the fetch_pods.pl script.

To use it, create an MP3::PodcastFetch object with the required
B<-base> and B<-rss> arguments. The podcasts listed in the RSS
subscription file located at the B<-rss> URL will be mirrored into one
or more subdirectories located beneath the path at B<-base>. One
subdirectory will be created for each channel specified by the
RSS. Additional new() arguments control optional features of this
module.

Once the object is created, call its fetch_pods() method to download
the RSS file, parse it, and mirror the subscribed podcasts locally.

=head1 METHODS

This module implements the following methods:

=cut

BEGIN {
  my @accessors = qw(base subdir override_channel_dir rss
		     max timeout mirror_mode verbose rewrite_filename upgrade_tags use_pub_date
		     keep_old playlist_handle playlist_base force_genre force_artist
		     force_album fetch_callback delete_callback env_proxy);

  for my $accessor (@accessors) {
eval <<END;
sub $accessor {
    my \$self = shift;
    my \$d    = \$self->{$accessor};
    \$self->{$accessor} = shift if \@_;
    return \$d;
}
END
  die $@ if $@;
  }
}

=head2 Constructor

 $feed = MP3::PodcastFetch->new(-base=>$base,-rss=>$url, [other args])

The new() method creates a new MP3::PodcastFetch object. Options are
as follows:

=over 4

=item -base

The base directory for all mirrored podcast files,
e.g. "/var/podcasts". Fetched podcasts files will be stored into
appropriately-named subdirectories of this location, one subdirectory
per channel. Additional subdirectory levels can be added using the
B<-subdirs> argument. This argument is required.

=item -override_channel_dir

Default is to use directory named after a channel title.  Specify
another directory instead.

=item -rss

The URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to. This is usually indicated in
web pages as a red "podcast" or "xml" icon. This argument is required.

=item -verbose

If true, print status messages to STDERR for each podcast file
attempted.

=item -env_proxy

If true, load proxy settings from *_proxy environment variables.

=item -max

Set the maximum number of podcast episodes to keep.

=item -keep_old

If true, keep old episodes and skip new ones if B<-max> is
exceeded. The default is to delete old episodes to make room for new
ones.

=item -timeout

How long (in seconds) to wait before timing out slow servers. Applies
to both the initial RSS feed fetching and mirroring individual podcast
episodes.

=item -mirror_mode

One of "exists" or "modified-since". The default, "exists", will cause
podcast episodes to be skipped if a like-named file already
exists. "modified-since" performs a more careful comparison with the
corresponding podcast episode on the remote server. The local file
will be refreshed if the remote server's version is more recent.

=item -rewrite_filename

If true, cryptic MP3 names will be replaced with long names based on
podcast episode title.

=item -upgrade_tag

Some podcast files have informative ID3 tags, but many
don't. Particularly annoying is the genre, which may be given as
"Speech", "Podcast", or anything else. The upgrade_tag option, if set
to a non-false value, will attempt to normalize the ID3 tags from the
information provided by the RSS feed information. Specifically, the
title will be set to the title of the podcast, the album will be set
to the title of the channel (e.g. "New York Times Front Page"), the
artist will be set to the channel author (e.g. "The New York Times"),
the year will be set to the publication date, the genre will be set to
"Podcast" and the comment will be set to the channel description. You
can change some of these values using the options "force_genre,"
"force_album," and "force_artist."

The value of upgrade_tag is one of:

 false     Don't mess with the ID3 tags
 id3v1     Upgrade the ID3 version 1 tag
 id3v2.3   Upgrade the ID3 version 2.3 tag
 id3v2.4   Upgrade the ID3 version 2.4 tag
 auto      Choose the best tag available

Depending on what optional Perl ID3 manipulation modules you have
installed, you may be limited in what level of ID3 tag you can update:

 Audio::TagLib            all versions through 2.4
 MP3::Tag                 all versions through 2.3
 MP3::Info                only version 1.0

Choosing "auto" is your best bet. It will dynamically find what Perl
modules you have installed, and choose the one that provides the most
recent tag version. Omit this argument, or set it to false, to prevent
any ID3 tag rewriting from occurring.

=item -force_genre, -force_artist, -force_album

If you have "upgrade_tag" set to a true value (and at least one
tag-writing module installed) then each podcast's ID3 tag will be
modified to create a consistent set of fields using information
provided by the RSS feed. The title will be set to the title of the
podcast, the album will be set to the title of the channel (e.g. "New
York Times Front Page"), the artist will be set to the channel author
(e.g. "The New York Times"), the year will be set to the publication
date, the genre will be set to "Podcast" and the comment will be set
to the channel description.

You can change some of these values using these three options:

 -force_genre     Change the genre to whatever you specify.
 -force_artist    Change the artist.
 -force_album     Change the album.

Note that if you use ID3v1 tagging (e.g. MP3::Info) then you must
choose one of the predefined genres; in particular, there is no genre
named "Podcast." You must force something else, like "Speech" instead.

=item -playlist_handle

A writeable filehandle on a previously-opened .m3u playlist file. The
playlist file must already have the "#EXTM3U" top line written into
it. The podcast fetch operation will write an appropriate item
description for each podcast episode it mirrors.

=item -playlist_base

If you are writing a playlist and mirroring the podcasts to a
removable medium such as an sdcard for later use with a portable music
player device, you will need to set this argument to the directory
path to each podcast file as it will appear to the music player. For
example, if you mount the medium at /mnt/sdcard and keep podcasts in
/mnt/sdcard/podcasts, then the B<-base> and B<-playlist_base> options
might look like this:

  -base          => '/mnt/sdcard/podcasts',
  -playlist_base => '/podcasts'

For Windows-based devices, you might have to specify a playlist_base
using Windows filesystem conventions.

=item -subdir

Ordinarily each podcast will be placed in a directory named after its
channel, directly underneath the directory specified by "base." If
this boolean is set to a partial path, then additional levels of
directory will be placed between the base and the channel
directory. For instance:

 -base    => '/tmp/podcasts',
 -subdir  => 'News/Daily',

Will place the channel's podcasts in '/tmp/podcasts/News/Daily/channel_name/'

=item -force_genre, -force_artist, -force_album

If B<-upgrade_tag> is set to true, then you can use these options to
force the genre, artist and/or album to desired hard-coded values. By
default, genre will be set to "Podcast", and artist and album will be
dynamically determined from information provided by the RSS feed, such
that the channel name becomes the album and the podcast author becomes
the artist.

=item -use_pub_date

If B<-use_pub_date> is set to true, then podcast files will have their
modification times set to match the publication time specified in the
RSS feed. Otherwise they will take retain the modification time they
carry on the site they are downloaded from.

=item -fetch_callback

If you provide a coderef to B<-fetch_callback> this routine will be
invoked on every file fetched immediately after the file is
created. It will be called with two arguments corresponding to the
MP3::PodcastFetch object, and the complete path to the fetched file:

   my $callback = sub {
       my ($feed,$filepath) = @_;
       print STDERR "$filepath successfully fetched\n";
   }

   $feed = MP3::PodcastFetch->new(-base           => $base,
                                  -rss            => $url,
                                  -fetch_callback => $callback);


=item -delete_callback

Similar to B<-fetch_callback> except that the passed coderef is called
on every deleted file immediately after the file is deleted.

=item $duration = $feed->get_duration($filename,$item)

This method is used to provide extended information for .m3u
playlists.

Get the duration, in seconds, of the podcast episode given by
$filename. If an ID3 tagging library is available, the duration will
be calculated from the MP3 file directory. Otherwise, it will fall
back to using the duration specified by the RSS feed's
MP3::PodcastFetch::Feed::Item object. Many RSS feeds do not specify
the duration, in which case get_duration() will return 0.

=item $filename = $feed->make_filename($url,$title)

Create a filename for the episode located at $url based on its $title
or the last component of the URL, depending on -rewrite_filename
argument provided to new().

=cut

=item $path = $feed->generate_directory($channel)

Create a directory for the channel specified by the provided
MP3::PodcastFetch::Feed::Channel object, respecting the values of
-base and -subdir. The path is created in an OS-independent way, using
File::Spec->catfile(). The directory will be created if it doesn't
already exist. If it already exists and is not writeable, the method
errors out.

=item $dirname = $feed->channel_dir($channel)

Generate a directory named based on the provided channel object's title,
unless it is overriden by B<-override_channel_dir> value.

=cut

sub channel_dir {
  my $self    = shift;
  my $channel = shift;

}

=item $safe_str = $feed->safe_str($unsafe_str)

This method generates OS-safe path components from channel and podcast
titles. It replaces whitespace and other odd characters with
underscores.
